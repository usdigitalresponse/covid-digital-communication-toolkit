* **Design for Cognitive and Visual Impairment Needs.** Follow baseline Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and is ADA compliant in all online communication. Ensure screen reader and other assistive technologies are supported in the design.
* **Highlight Accessible Accomodations.** Clearly highlighting accessibility accommodations at vaccine provider locations will help alleviate any fear of not being able to get to a vaccine appointment. Consider representing this accessibility \(ramp access, etc\) in imagery.
