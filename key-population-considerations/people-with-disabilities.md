**Highlight Accessible Accomodations. Clearly highlighting accessibility accommodations at vaccine provider locations will help alleviate any fear of not being able to get to a vaccine appointment. Consider representing this accessibility \(ramp access, etc\) in imagery.**

* **Recognize diversity. Itâ€™s imperative to recognize the diversity in needs among people with disabilities and the sub-communities therewithin. There is no one-size fits all approach.** 
* **Design for Cognitive and Visual Impairment Needs. Follow baseline Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and is ADA compliant in all online communication. Ensure screen reader and other assistive technologies are supported in the design.**
