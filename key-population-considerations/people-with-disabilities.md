# People with Disabilities

{% hint style="info" %}
**Physiological Pathways:** Recognize the diversity of needs among people with disabilities and the sub-communities therein. There is no one-size-fits-all approach.
{% endhint %}

**Here are some guidelines for reaching people with disabilities**

* **Design for cognitive and visual impairment needs.** Follow baseline Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and ensure ADA compliance in all online communication. Ensure screen readers and other assistive technologies are supported in the design.
* **Highlight accessible accommodations.** Clearly highlighting accessibility accommodations at vaccine provider locations will help alleviate any fear of not being able to get to a vaccine appointment. Consider representing this accessibility \(ramp access, etc\) in imagery.
