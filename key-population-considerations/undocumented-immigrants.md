# Undocumented Immigrants

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Systems of Power:** noncitizen immigrants face a range of potential access-related barriers to obtaining a COVID-19 vaccination. 
{% endhint %}

According to [KFF](https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/immigrant-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-key-issues-to-consider/), noncitizen immigrants are more likely than citizens to be uninsured and, as a result, are less likely to have a usual source of care as well as more likely to delay or go without it and to have concerns about its costs. 

People who are uninsured may be more likely to have concerns about the potential costs associated with obtaining the vaccine. 

Below are resources to support undocumented workers and their employers with flyers, occupation letters, and undocumented immigrant letters provided by [NYC Epicenter.](https://epicenter-nyc.com/what-we-learned-registering-thousands-of-our-neighbors-for-vaccines/)
