# Toolkit Walkthrough

Communication and content development teams at local and state governments vary in their **COVID-19 comms response strategy** to vaccinations and testing. 

Answering the questions below will help you and your team understand how you can best use this toolkit:

**Have you integrated health equity best practices into your COVID-19 digital communication such as on your agency's website, mobile, marketing, and social media campaigns?**

* [ ] **If yes,** do you have a health equity task force or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion \(DEI\) committee to support you in developing equitable COVID-19 communication?

  * [ ] **If yes**, start at [Checklists](../tools-and-templates/checklists.md) and [Website Template](../tools-and-templates/website-template.md)
  * [ ] **If no**, start at [Resident Personas](../what-we-know/resident-personas.md)

* [ ] **If you have not** made any decisions about health equity yet, start with [Health Equity Framework Overview](../health-equity-framework/framework-overview.md).
