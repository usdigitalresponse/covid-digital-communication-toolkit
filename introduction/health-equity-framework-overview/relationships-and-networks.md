# Relationships and Networks

Maintaining social relationships is important for maintaining health. Relationships and networks include family structure, friends, romantic partners, cultural communities, schools, and neighborhoods. Relationships may promote health equity with **protective factors** **against health-harming behaviors** \(Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010\), or intensify poorer health outcomes by enabling health-harming behaviors \(Patton et al., 2016\).
