# Health Equity Framework

**Health equity** is defined as having the personal agency and fair access to resources and opportunities needed to achieve the best possible physical, emotional, and social well-being. The Health Equity Framework \(HEF\) centers on **four spheres of influence** to impact population health outcomes: 1\) [relationships and networks](relationships-and-networks.md), 2\) [systems of power](systems-of-power.md), 3\) [physiological pathways](physiological-pathways.md), and 4\) [individual factors](individual-factors.md).

HEF is a practical tool for communication leaders, educators, and health literacy professionals in public health research and practice. It reflects on COVID-19 digital communication tools and supports a **shift toward addressing** health inequities resulting from the interplay of structural, relational, individual, and physiological factors. **Practical examples of the HEF are reflected in the Tools and Templates section.**

Our focus is on residentsâ€™ need for accurate, timely, transparent, and equitable COVID-19 communication. HEF is reflected in the following diagram:
