# Physiological Pathways

{% hint style="info" %}
**Physiological Pathways:** a person's biological, physical, cognitive, and psychological abilities \(Peterson et al., 2020\).
{% endhint %}

Physiological pathways can impact health outcomes substantially. The **timing and intensity** of key determinants can change developmental, biological, and cognitive trajectories, leading to poorer health outcomes. For example, adults with specific learning disabilities \(SLD\) reported lower scores in reading comprehension, functional reading skills, and general intelligence than non-SLD groups. Individuals with SLDs highlight their condition was worse in adulthood due to extended adverse childhood adversities \(Patterson and Mellard, 2008\).

When applying **physiological pathways in practice,** we focus on:

1. Increasing awareness of how physiological responses can be driven by other spheres of influence, and
2. How interventions can maximize and support the resilience of physiological functions and abilities after exposure.
