# Physiological Pathways

{% hint style="info" %}
**Physiological Pathways:** a person's biological, physical, cognitive, and psychological abilities.
{% endhint %}

Physiological pathways can impact health outcomes substantially. The **timing and intensity** of key determinants can change developmental, biological, and cognitive trajectories, leading to poorer health outcomes. For example, adults with specific learning disabilities \(SLD\) reported lower scores in reading comprehension, functional reading skills, and general intelligence than non-SLD groups. Individuals with SLDs identify their condition as worse in adulthood due to extended childhood adversities.

When applying **physiological pathways in practice,** we focus on:

1. Increasing awareness of how physiological responses can be driven by other spheres of influence, and
2. How interventions can maximize and support the resilience of physiological functions and abilities after exposure.
