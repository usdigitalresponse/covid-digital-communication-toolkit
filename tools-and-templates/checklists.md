# Checklist

We listed an audit checklist that you can use to evaluate your digital tools such as a website, mobile app, social media content, and digital print media. This checklist centralizes recommendations derived from [Health Literacy Online](https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/) and ETR's [Health Equity Framework](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1524839920950730).

### 1. Learn about your users and their goals

* [ ] Who are your **users?**
* [ ] What are your users' **challenges and fears** regarding COVID-19 and the vaccine?
* [ ] What are their **motivations** on your website? Why are they here?
* [ ] What are they trying to do on your digital tool? i.e. **goals and user's definition of success**
* [ ] What are the **individual** **factors** that impact your users' attitudes and behaviors towards searching and accepting COVID-19 vaccine information? e.x. a built environment such as access to the internet, mobile phone, and a computer
* [ ] What are your users' **physiological pathways**? e.x. cognitive and comprehension disabilities and conditions such as Dementia, Alzheimers, and Parkinson's Disease
* [ ] What **networks and relationships** do they value the most to learn about COVID-19 information? e.x. a trust messenger/ [health translator](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/39-voices-_-covid-sprint-_-full-deck/) from their communities, family, friends, schools, religious institutes \(church, temple, mosque\)
* [ ] What are **systems of power** that prevent or accelerate their access to accurate and transparent COVID-19 information? e.x. undocumented immigrant, lack of insurance, rural community access to healthcare

### 2. Write actionable content

* [ ] Did you put the **most important information first** at the top of the page, above [the fold](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/glossary/what-is-the-fold/)?
* [ ] What is the **health behavior** that you want your users to do? e.x. check vaccination eligibility, or learn more about vaccine side effects
* [ ] Did you set **realistic and positive** expectations? e.x. include the benefits of taking action to set a prevention plan against COVID-19 for your family
* [ ] Did you provide **specific action steps** for your users to do immediately? Instead of telling users _what_ to do, tell them _how_ to do it
