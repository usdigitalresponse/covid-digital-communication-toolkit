# Checklist

Following the KISS rule \(Keep It Simple, Stupid\), linked below is a resource produced by [NYC Opportunity](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/about/about-nyc-opportunity.page#:~:text=The%20Mayor's%20Office%20for%20Economic%20Opportunity%20%28NYC%20Opportunity%29%20uses%20evidence,service%20delivery%2C%20and%20budget%20decisions.) \(NYC Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity\) that includes tools and tactics for civic service design regarding COVID-19 public health efforts that can also be applied to the broader design realm. Use these tips to amp up concreteness to more effectively catch your target user’s attention and make them more likely to perform the key behavior.

We created the following audit checklist, which you can use to evaluate your digital tools, such as a website, mobile app, social media content, and digital print media. This checklist centralizes recommendations derived from [Health Literacy Online](https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/), ETR's [Health Equity Framework](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1524839920950730), and [design thinking](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking). 

### 1. Learn about your users and their goals

* [ ] Who are your **users?**
* [ ] What are your users' **challenges and fears** regarding COVID-19 and the vaccine?
* [ ] What are their **motivations** on your website? Why are they here?
* [ ] What are they trying to do on your digital tool? i.e. **goals and user's definition of success**.
* [ ] What are the **individual** **factors** that impact your users' attitudes and behaviors towards searching and accepting COVID-19 vaccine information? e.g. a built environment such as access to the internet, mobile phone, and a computer.
* [ ] What are your users' **physiological pathways**? e.g. cognitive and comprehension disabilities and conditions such as Dementia, Alzheimers, and Parkinson's Disease.
* [ ] What **networks and relationships** do they value the most to learn about COVID-19 information? e.g. a trust messenger/ [health translator](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/39-voices-_-covid-sprint-_-full-deck/) from their communities, family, friends, schools, religious institutes \(church, temple, mosque\).
* [ ] What are the **systems of power** that prevent or accelerate their access to accurate and transparent COVID-19 information? e.g. undocumented immigrants, lack of insurance, rural community access to healthcare.
* [ ] Did you use **bold colors** with contrast in alignment with [508 compliance](https://www.hhs.gov/web/section-508/accessibility-checklists/index.html)? e.g. avoid dark backgrounds.

### 2. Write actionable content

* [ ] Did you put the **most important information first** at the top of the page, above [the fold](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/glossary/what-is-the-fold/)?
* [ ] What is the **health behavior** that you want your users to do? e.g. check vaccination eligibility, or learn more about vaccine side effects.
* [ ] Did you set **realistic and positive** expectations? e.g. include the benefits of taking action to set a prevention plan against COVID-19 for your family.
* [ ] Did you provide **specific action steps** for your users to do immediately? Instead of telling users _what_ to do, tell them _how_ to do it.
* [ ] Did you write in **plain language**? Use familiar language and an active voice. e.g. _"When you get the COVID-19 vaccine, the nurse will give you an immunization card with your vaccine dose 1 brand name, date, and location of vaccine administration."_
* [ ] Did you check your **content for accuracy?** Include the date when the content was last reviewed and the reviewer's name and contact information to give your content more credibility with your users.

### **3. Display content clearly on the page**

* [ ] Did you limit **paragraph size?** Use bullets and shortlists.
* [ ] Did you use **meaningful** **headings?**
* [ ] Did you use a **familiar font** with at least 12-point type for print media and 16-point type for a website and mobile view?
* [ ] Did you use **white space** and reduced clutter?
* [ ] Did you keep content? In the **center of the screen** and above the fold?
* [ ] Did you label **links** clearly?
* [ ] Did you use **images** that facilitate learning and reduce negative emotions? e.g. avoid vaccine imagery that [could deter people with needle phobias](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/needles-fear-coronavirus-vaccine/2020/12/22/1c554500-408a-11eb-8db8-395dedaaa036_story.html).
* [ ] Did you use **bold colors** with contrast? Avoid dark backgrounds.
* [ ] Did you make your site and documents **accessible** to [people with disabilities](../key-population-considerations/people-with-disabilities.md)? Learn more about [508 compliance](https://www.hhs.gov/web/section-508/accessibility-checklists/index.html).

### 4. Organize content and simplify navigation

* [ ] Did you create a simple and **engaging** **homepage**? Users with limited literacy skills have difficulty processing multiple concepts at the same time, so include as few elements as possible on the homepage.
* [ ] Did you use **labels** that reflect words your users know? To help different users find what they need, repeat topics under multiple categories. For example, based on card sorting, content on [vaccination eligibility](https://www.figma.com/proto/dyiSesOAZM9NIDqogoqbdr/USDR-Vaccine-Website-Template?node-id=737%3A379&scaling=min-zoom) in our vaccine website template appears under three categories: Homepage, Find Vaccines, Phases.
* [ ] Did you enable **easy access** to home and menu pages?
* [ ] Did you ensure that the **"Back" buttons** work? 
* [ ] Did you use **linear information paths**? This is especially important in completing vaccine eligibility forms and registering for a vaccination appointment.
* [ ] Did you include **simple search** and browse options? Include language translation options for multilingual users.

### 5. Engage users with interactive content

* [ ] Did you include **printer-friendly tools** and resources? e.g. provide a link to printable pages. We learned users with limited literacy skills prefer to print pages from a website, rather than read text on a computer screen. Also, they may want to share health information with family members or friends who don't have access to a computer or post it on their fridge.
* [ ] Did you simplify **screen-based controls** and enlarge buttons? e.g. design buttons that are easy to find and click. Some users with limited literacy skills do not understand the term "Submit". So use an alternative like "Go" or "Get Started".
* [ ] Did you include **interactive content** that users can tailor, but not too much? Users want personalized health information, but they don't want to enter a lot of personal data.

* [ ] Did you incorporate audio and **visual features to build trust** in the community? Evidence-based research shows that audio and video can enhance comprehension and retention of online information. Using a **role-modeling strategy**, such as video testimonials or flyers, is key when engaging the Hispanic community, where adult immunization rates are already much lower than among whites.
* [ ] Did you include **social media** for increased engagement and social proof?

### 6. Evaluate, measure, and revise your digital tool

* [ ] If budget allows, did you **recruit users** with limited literacy and limited health literacy skills from various backgrounds and conduct **usability testing**? This option may not be practical for health content developers, so, instead, you can use a **proxy** for health literacy. Usability will help test comprehension in multiple ways, such as having users think out loud as they complete tasks and having them describe what they've read in their own words.
* [ ] Did you integrate **analytics** to track users' flow in your digital tools and gauge their behaviors?
* [ ] Did you recruit **diverse moderators** and/or researchers for testing? Whenever possible, use moderators who share similar cultural experiences and values when working with people with limited literacy skills and those of diverse demographics.
* [ ] Did you create **plain-language testing** documents? e.g. screeners, consent forms, and moderator guides. As a general rule, limit the number of tasks and questions when conducting usability testing with users with limited literacy skills.
