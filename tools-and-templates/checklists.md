# Checklist

We listed an audit checklist that you can use to evaluate your digital tools such as a website, mobile app, social media content, and digital print media. This checklist centralizes recommendations derived from [Health Literacy Online](https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/) and ETR's [Health Equity Framework](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1524839920950730).
