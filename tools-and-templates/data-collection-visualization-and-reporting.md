# Data Collection, Visualization, and Reporting

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Systems of Power:** Place-based health metrics like these capture key contributors to the risk of getting COVID-19 or having a worse outcome including poverty, reliance on public transportation, and crowded housing.
{% endhint %}

The National Academies’ report recommends **place-based measures** of social vulnerability, such as the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention Social Vulnerability Index \(SVI\) or the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index \(CCVI\), which includes racial, ethnic, and language composition of a census tract.
