# Vaccine Outreach Channels

We have listed outreach channels to reach marginalized populations, hard-to-reach, rural communities, and other identities such as undocumented workers, those with limited digital literacy levels, and uninsured people. 

The list is based on literature and landscape review and ongoing discussions with state and local government partners and community-based organizations. It includes **push/ outbound** and **pull/ inbound** marketing methods to meet people where they are at.

* **Radio** ads to reach undocumented workers, the uninsured, farmers, and digital desserts
* **Spotify** and Pandora Ads
* **Social media** toolkits such as [HHS' We Can Do This Kit](https://wecandothis.hhs.gov/filter/format/Social%20Media)
