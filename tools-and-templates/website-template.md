# Website Template

In December 2020, we created a **vaccine website template,** designed for communication and development teams to launch their own vaccine website or webpages in hours. Linked below are links to step-by-step instructions and a design for content managers, designers, and developers to use for their county and states.

The template is designed to meet the needs of the majority of counties. It’s built on **WordPress**, which is an easy platform to set up and customize for your own county with limited technical knowledge. It is simple to maintain and update during vaccine distribution. In addition, this user guide is written for public health officials – not tech experts - who are familiar with Internet basics.
