# Vaccine Hesitancy

**Vaccine hesitancy can be thought of as a continuum**. It can range from indecision, uncertainty, delay, and then, at most severe - reluctance \(SAGE Working Group, 2014\). Each of these forms of hesitancies can be influenced by several factors. 

**These are referred to as the 5 A’s:** Access, Affordability, Awareness, Acceptance, Activation \(Thomson et al., 2016\). When applying the health equity framework principles, the 5A taxonomy can help guide your vaccine campaigns’ communication and collateral strategy.

### Communication Tactics for Vaccine Confidence

**Moderate your organization's social media** and marketing platforms by assigning a community manager to engage with residents apply the SWIFT Method \(Caulfield, 2020\) to respond to misinformation:

* **Stop**: when you encounter potential misinformation. Even deciding not to share the content is a success metric
* **Investigate the source:** who is sharing the information? Is this from a reputable source \(sometimes there's no source, or there is imposter content\)? Use Google to look up news sources
* **Find better coverage:** look up what other coverage is on the same topic/ event. Focus on trusted sources by fact-checking sites. Do reverse image searches for false context of connection
* **Trace claims, quotes, and media to the original context:** click through links to find the original source.
