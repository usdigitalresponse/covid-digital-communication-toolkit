The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) created the [Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication \(CERC\)](https://emergency.cdc.gov/cerc/index.asp) to share lessons learned during past public health emergencies and research in the fields of public health, psychology, and emergency risk communication. 

The CERC program provides training, tools, and resources to help health communicators, emergency responders, and leaders of organizations communicate effectively during emergencies.
