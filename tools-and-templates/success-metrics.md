# Success Metrics

Local and state government agencies and community-based organizations have the opportunity to impact COVID-19 vaccination rates in the US **to eliminate vaccine-preventable COVID-19 infections**. This work is prevention at its purest level, and its impact will be felt for generations to come. The USDR Covid Digital Communications Toolkit supports your communication teams with content and messaging tools with the following goals:

1. Increase COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States across all 50 states.
2. Eliminate racial disparity and reduce geographic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination.

The following logic model is a high-level overview of the flow of materials and processes for equitable communication during COVID-19 vaccine distribution.
