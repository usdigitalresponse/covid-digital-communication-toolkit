# Social Media Playbook and Templates

{% hint style="info" %}
We understand there are limited resources and time, so this was created with that in mind. This is the leanest possible way to help governments audit, strategize and deploy a social media strategy. The first session will take up to 1 hour, then we'll schedule additional workshops to dive deeper, depending on needs.
{% endhint %}

### Social Media Templates

Below are multiple **templates** we created based on our qualitative research with bilingual residents from various states and counties with messaging that resonates. The design and content files are available for public use. To use and even edit the Figma files, you will need to create a Figma account \(it's free!\):

Our **design and content guidelines** listed below are best practices to post on social media. The guidelines are themes from generative research we conducted with residents and local and state government partners to understand vaccination messaging with BIPOC communities:
