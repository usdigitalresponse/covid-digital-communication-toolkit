# Social Media Playbook

Our playbook will help you audit, strategize, and distribute trusted COVID-19 content across social media channels.

{% hint style="info" %}
We understand there are limited resources and time, so this was created with that in mind. This is the leanest possible way to help governments audit, strategize and deploy a social media strategy. The first session will take up to 1 hour, then we'll schedule additional workshops to dive deeper, depending on needs.
