# Search and Navigation

When navigating a website, users with limited literacy skills tend to:

* **Get distracted** by extra words and elements of a website like links and icons
* **Navigate** in a linear fashion and backtrack frequently
* **Choose the first** answer they find, without checking if it’s correct—and have a hard time telling the difference between high- and low-quality information
* **Have** **trouble** recovering from mistakes

When reading, users with limited literacy skills focus on the **center of the screen.** Once they shift their focus from the navigation to the center of the screen, they’re unlikely to look back to the navigation to solve a problem or change course if the content isn’t meeting their needs.

#### **How do people currently navigate information about how they will get a vaccine and learn about their eligibility?**

* **Top three search takeaways:**

  * **Search 1:** Multiple searches, vague information, PDF downloads, and no answer
  * **Search 2:** State government and public health websites that highlight a prioritization framework, with no current details on next steps
  * **Search 3:** Going straight to workplace resources or to your primary care provider
