# Case Studies

We have been supporting local and state governments with evaluating their COVID-19 web and mobile pages and providing tactical recommendations for improved user experience and content literacy, education, and communication. 

Our focus with these case studies is on **convenience**: Is it easy to get the vaccine? We also prioritized a mobile-first experience informed by our partner's web analytics.

Below are examples of before and after we have designed for government partners with best practices in three areas:

1. Site navigation
2. Visual design
3. Content strategy
