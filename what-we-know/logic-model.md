### Opportunity 

USDR has the opportunity to impact Covid-19 vaccination rates in the U.S.: to eliminate vaccine-preventable Covid-19 infections. This work is prevention at its purest level and its impact will be felt for generations to come. The vaccination communication program will support government vaccine providers to best prepare for the vaccine administration lifecycle with the technology tools to help facilitate each step.

### Goals

1. Increase Covid-19 vaccination rates in the United States across all 50 states
2. Eliminate racial disparity and reduce geographic disparities in Covid-19 vaccination
