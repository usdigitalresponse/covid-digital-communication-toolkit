### Opportunity 

Local and state government agencies have the opportunity to impact COVID-19 vaccination rates in the US: to **eliminate vaccine-preventable** COVID-19 infections. This work is prevention at its purest level and its impact will be felt for generations to come. The vaccination communication program will support government communication teams to best prepare for the vaccine administration lifecycle with the content and messaging tools to help facilitate each step.

### Goals

1. Increase COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States across all 50 states
2. Eliminate racial disparity and reduce geographic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination
