# Mental Model

We have conducted remote observations and contextual inquiry as part of a qualitative study with a small sample of residents from various phases of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. In addition, we analyzed over 75 state and local COVID-19 vaccine websites for best practices on vaccination eligibility. This is what we learned from residents about residents' mental models:   

### **How do people currently think about getting a vaccine?**

**What do you know about getting vaccines?** Users knowledge level varied about receiving the vaccine from not much, 2 doses, rolling out now, to some level of phase prioritization. People, in general, are not sure _when_ and _where_ to get vaccinated for Covid-19 especially for the “wait-and-see” groups.

**When will you be able to get a vaccine?** We also learned that timing is random based on a resident's social network, with the highest frequency mentioned in March, June, and the Fall.

**How important is the vaccine in your life?** Vaccine importance is role-dependent. Teachers and essential workers feel like this is very important. 

**How do you want to get the vaccine?** There are two sides to the coin. 

* **Realistically**: Residents currently have to go somewhere, such as a hospital or community center, sign up, and wait for a response. This is slightly inconvenient for them.
* **Ideally**: At work, so residents don’t have to travel out of their way. They want to go somewhere and to someone familiar to them, such as their Primary Care Physician.

**Who should make decisions about vaccine distribution?** There’s a range of responses: A mix of people, people with clout, and scientists. A December Morning Consult poll found that a majority of US adults turn to their families for vaccine guidance.

**What is the role of the federal government in vaccine distribution?** From residents:

* “Ensure we have enough vaccines for everybody and work on distribution.”
* “Make sure it’s available regardless of money and geographic area.”
* “Strong federal guidelines, procedures and protocols.”
* “Coordinating with state, local governments on prioritization and delivery.”
