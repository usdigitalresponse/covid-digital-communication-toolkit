# Physiological Pathways

{% hint style="info" %}
**Physiological Pathways:** are a person's biological, physical, cognitive, and psychological abilities \(Peterson et al., 2020\).
{% endhint %}

These factors contribute substantially to health outcomes but cannot be easily, or in some cases ethically, modified by intervention. This sphere of influence also concerns how the timing and intensity of other determinants might change developmental, biological, and cognitive trajectories that lead to poorer health outcomes. For example, extreme or extended activation of the physiological stress response that results from early childhood adversities \(e.g., extreme poverty, interpersonal, or community violence\) disrupts development of brain architecture and function, neuroendocrine stress response, and immune system function; these disruptions are precursors to impairments in social and emotional behaviors and physical and mental illness over the lifespan \(Johnson et al., 2013\). When applying physiological pathways in practice, we focus on \(1\) increasing awareness of how physiological responses can be driven by other spheres of influence and \(2\) how interventions can maximize and support the resilience of physiological functions and abilities after exposure.
