# Overview

**Health equity** is defined as having the personal agency and fair access to resources and opportunities needed to achieve the best possible physical, emotional, and social well-being \(ETR, 2020\). ETR, an organization that advances health equity through education, training, and research evaluation, developed the Health Equity Framework \(HEF\). HEF centers on **four spheres of influence** to impact population health outcomes: 1\) relationships and networks, 2\) systems of power, 3\) physiological pathways, and 4\) individual factors \(Peterson et al., 2020\).

HEF is a practical tool for communication leaders, educators, and health literacy professionals in public health research and practice. It reflects on COVID-19 digital communication tools and supports a **shift toward addressing** health inequities resulting from the interplay of structural, relational, individual, and physiological factors. HEF will be reflected in every section under Tools and Templates.

Our focus is on residentsâ€™ need for accurate, timely, transparent, and equitable COVID-19 communication. HEF is reflected in the following diagram:
