# Systems of Power

Systems of power refer to **policies, processes,** and practices that determine the distribution and access to resources and opportunities needed to be healthy. Systems of power—as opposed to social conditions such as poverty—contribute to the systematic and differential treatment of groups and include institutionalized and interpersonal manifestations of bias \(Raymond, 2016\).

Where systems of power have been restructured to repair the historical and current causes of health disparities, they may **promote health equity** by ensuring fair access to resources and opportunities. The HEF views these systems as functioning at varying levels in both political \(federal, state, and local\) and institutional \(school, private companies, health care systems\) spaces.
